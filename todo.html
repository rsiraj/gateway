        <h3>Hussaini Hanging Bridge</h3>
        <img src="/images/todo5.jpg" alt="Hussaini hanging bridge">
        <p>Located in Hunza region, the Hussaini Hanging Bridge looks the sort of crossing Indiana Jones would think twice about traversing. With travel in this gorgeous but stark landscape understandably difficult, these types of bridges are the only way of getting around for those who don’t have the money to fly. Swaying gently over the Hunza River, the Hussaini Hanging Bridge’s rickety combination of narrow ropes and wooden planks has enticed many thrill-seekers, photographers, and tourists from Pakistan and beyond.</p>

        <h3>Altit Fort</h3>
        <img src="/images/todo6.jpg" alt="altit fort">
        <p>Altit Fort is a spectacularly sited defensive work overlooking the Hunza river valley in Gilgit-Baltistan. Carbon-14 dating of its central shikari (watchtower) has shown that at least part of the central tower of the fort was built over a thousand years ago. However, many of the fort’s buildings probably date from later periods, as indicated by dates corresponding either to 1583 or 1581 that were discovered on a lintel of a door frame in the shikari. Traditionally, village lore holds that the fort was constructed by craftsmen from Baltistan, who came here at the behest of the Balti princess Ayashu who was married to the Mir of Hunza, Shah Khan. Although the primary purpose of the fort was defensive, it also served as the seat of power of the Mir of Hunza before the political center moved to nearby Baltit (modern-day Karimabad).</p>
